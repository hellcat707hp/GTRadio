# Contributing to GTRadio
GTRadio started as a personal project, but I'd love to see it grow and become better. All I ask is that we stick to some basic rules.

## Conduct
Communications regarding this project should be constructive, relevant, and appropriate. Innapropriate conduct, such as trolling, harrassment, and personal attacks, will not be tolerated.

## General Questions?
Questions about using and setting up the app can be asked and discussed over in the [Q&A of Discussions](https://github.com/hellcat707hp/GTRadio/discussions/categories/q-a).

## Found a Bug?
First, go see if the bug has an [issue](https://github.com/hellcat707hp/GTRadio/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/hellcat707hp/GTRadio/pulls) already.

If not, submit an issue or even a pull request with the fix.

## Missing Feature?
First, go see if the feature has been [discussed](https://github.com/hellcat707hp/GTRadio/discussions/categories/ideas) 
or if an [issue](https://github.com/hellcat707hp/GTRadio/labels/enhancement) or [pull request](https://github.com/hellcat707hp/GTRadio/pulls) exists for it already.

If not, you can request new features by using the Ideas section of Discussion or by submitting an issue appropriately tagged.

If you want to implement a new feature, major changes should be submitted as an appropriately tagged issue for discussion, but small additions can be direct pull requests.

## Submitting Issues and Pull Requests
Guidelines for issue and pull request formatting coming soon!
